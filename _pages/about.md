I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Information Systems, TU Braunschweig](http://www.ifis.cs.tu-bs.de) led by [Wolf-Tilo Balke](http://www.ifis.cs.tu-bs.de/staff/balke). I interested in research that bridges the gap between unstructured information (natural language text) and structured representations (document graphs, knowledge graphs, ...).  My research interests include narratives, narrative extraction, entity linking, information extraction and query processing. My research aims to bring more structure into otherwise unstructured collections.

I recieved my Bachelor's degree (B.Sc.) and my Master's degree from the [Leibniz University of Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de).
